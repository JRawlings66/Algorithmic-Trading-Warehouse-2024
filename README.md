Urban Agriculture Visualization Version 1:

The goal of this project is to create an interactive visualization tool that demonstrates the fundamentals of vertical agriculture production, introduces students to multiple food assets (e.g., urban farms, composters, digesters), explores food systems planning principles, and teaches students basic forms of data analysis pertinent to food and agriculture management. 
The visualization tool should provide interactivity (at a minimum, the ability for the student to walk around/explore, read, and toggle between scenes).  The first version of the tool has already been developed using Unity Game Engine software. The game is modelled on the University of the Fraser Campus, using Ortho imagery from the campus and prefabricated buildings from Dr. Robert Newell, SketchUp Warehouse, and the Unity Game Store. 
Additional structures, including all vertical agriculture equipment, have been made in SketchUp 3D.  Thus far, the game's premise is that there is an urban agriculture demonstration zone on UFVâ€™s campus. In this demonstration, a multitude of forms of agriculture (e.g., shipping container gardens, plant factories, market gardens, community composting) are described via popup text. Students can leave/enter the main demonstration zone, going through different scenes, including the interior of a vertical farm and rooftop agriculture setup.
